# COMP20003-Assignment1
Algorithm and Data Structures Assignment 1  
The assignment focuses on the implementation of a Doubly Connected Edge List (DCEL) data structure and performing splits on a convex polygon.

For transparency, I uploaded the code that I submitted for the assignment WITHOUT any changes. Therefore, some mistakes on using #include and struct declarations are kept.
